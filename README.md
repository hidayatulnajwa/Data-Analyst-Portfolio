# Portfolio Projects
**About Me**<br>
I’m a data Analyst with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and Tableau, which I gained through academic projects at Universiti Sains Malaysia and hands-on experience. (BSc in Mathematics, Minor in Computer Science). <br/>

Curious and self-driven, I enjoy transforming messy data into meaningful insights that drive decisions. From cleaning data to creating dashboards, I love every step of the process. I’ve worked on real-world projects involving sales, customer trends, and content performance, and I’m currently focused on sharpening my analytics skills through continuous learning and freelancing opportunities. <br/>

Beyond numbers, I bring strong communication, attention to detail, and a collaborative mindset that help me explain technical findings simply and effectively. <br/>

Now, I’m actively looking for opportunities in data analytics, where I can contribute, grow, and make an impact. <br/>

## Below is a selection of my projects in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau: <br/>

### (SQL + Power BI) Tihana Shop Sales Dashboard (Sept-Dec 2020)

It was a meaningful way to apply what I’ve learned to something real and personal.
